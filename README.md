# Solar Calculator

## Overview

A Solar Calculator web app. Our Solar calculator web app gives you useful information on the exact amount of solar panels you would need for your home and the amount of energy needed to supply your home electricity using solar energy. 

## How it works

To determine the amount of energy a user would need, they will have to provide their state of residence so as to determine the average sun hours in that state(assuming our user lives in Nigeria). They will also have to add some appliances, their quantity and the total number of hours each appliance worked. On clicking on a "calculate" button, users will be shown their total energy usage, the number of solar panels they need and the type of solar panel most suitable for them. 

## Extra features 

Users can also view a pie chart showing the ratio of energy consumed by each appliance.
